Tower of HanoiThe classic example of a recursive solution to a relatively complex problem is the Tower of Hanoi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi â€“ which is taught in every Computer Science program and in a lot of programming classes. As you add disks the solution becomes more complex, but it is a simple repetition of moves used in the 3 disk solution. Assignment A javascript program to demonstrate computational complexity. Using the wikipedia article; a computer program that calculates the number of moves necessary to solve Tower of Hanoi given a number of disks. Calculated by going through the recursive algorithm without making the actual moves.What is the Complexity (In Big O)?

Should we be concerned with concerned with the legend of the world ending when the 64 disk solution is physically solved it it takes 2 seconds for each move?
